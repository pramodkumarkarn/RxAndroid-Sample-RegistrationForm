# RxAndroid-Sample-RegistrationForm
Every UI element on your Android application emits events. The code that youâ€™ve been writing is a reaction to some event, such as user tapping a button or a REST response from your backend service. We usually handle it by multiple instances of event listeners such as OnClickListener. All is well until you try track and handle multiple states. The common example is validation of registration form. To tackle this, smart people from Netflix have made a nifty little library called RxJava and its binding for Android named RxAndroid.
